CPU-GPU-Loads.ods:
The data is split into two sheets: Tables and Graphs.

Tables:
The header "dim" denotes how many objects are in each of the three dimensions of our grid, e.g. dim = 5 => a 5x5x5 grid of cubes/skulls

We have collected data from three runs. In each run we collect data over 10 configurations: 

conf  #  dim
------#-------
 1    #   5
 2    #   10
 3    #   15
 4    #   20
 5    #   25
 6    #   30
 7    #   35
 8    #   40
 9    #   45
 10   #   50
 
For each configuration, we have ~30 data entries collected from Open Hardware Monitor (located in vk[b|mwd]-[run]-[conf].csv).

Let A be the average of these entries where ComponentType = "nvidiagpu" or "intelcpu" and SensorType = "Load" and SensorID = 0. 
This gives us the average load of the GPU or CPU for that configuration.

The header "AVG(Value)" is an average over A on the three runs.
